This repository is a playground for demonstrating how MASt3R (Matching with Asymmetric Stochastic Transformers) matching works, specifically without relying on any custom PyTorch CUDA/C++ kernels. The code provides a minimal, hackable example of running the MASt3R model, extracting features, and performing matching between images using only standard Python and JAX/NumPy operations. This makes it easier to understand, experiment with, and extend the matching pipeline, especially for research or educational purposes, without the complexity of low-level kernel dependencies.

To make this run as is, you will need conda. I have the backend in main set to mps right now, but you can make it whatever your heart desires. Just run setup.sh to get things setup and run main.py to visualize matches. Feel free to hack on this and hit me with PRs to make it more elegant.
